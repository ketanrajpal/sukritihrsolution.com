 <ul class="why-us-list clear">
   <li><strong>We provide greater access to desirable candidates.</strong>&nbsp;We actively manage our size  and client relationships so we can secure many candidates who are &ldquo;off limits&rdquo;  to our competition.</li>
   <li><strong>We win together.</strong>&nbsp;Our executive search  consultants work hard to build relationships, along with a deep understanding  of our clients&rsquo; needs. That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re designed to deliver responsiveness,  accountability, and a truly collaborative partnership—in addition to  exceptional results.</li>
   <li><strong>Our philosophy of transparency and accountability</strong>&nbsp;carries over to the way we  perform and audit our executive searches as well as to how we deal with our  clients and our colleagues. We communicate regularly and responsively. With  every search, we establish critical milestones at <strong>48 hours, 14 days, 40 days and 75 days</strong> that enable us to gauge  search status and make necessary revisions. </li>
   <li><strong>The 40-Day Audit</strong>&nbsp;provides independent,  comprehensive, formal feedback that helps ensure milestones are met according  to client expectations and offers suggestions for refining the search.</li>
   <li><strong>Client  Quality Satisfaction Survey</strong>&nbsp;is  a post-search opportunity for continuous improvement, based on clients&rsquo;  assessment of each facet of a recently completed search. Survey findings are  ranked, reviewed and posted internally—because our consultants take the Survey  findings very seriously.</li>
